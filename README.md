## BUILDING AND ISSUING FUNGIBLE TOKENS ON NEAR
----

We're going to use NEAR's Fungible Token Standard (NEP-21), and Ethereum's ERC-20 standard as the basis for this project which will do the following:  

- Allows someone to create a Fungible Token on the NEAR blockchain;
- Adds some additional functionality to that token that is found in the ERC-20 standard but is not currently found in the NEAR fungible token spec (minting, burning); and
- Build out beginning of a user role system that allows token owner and users to use the token in different ways.

We're going to build the contracts with AssemblyScript and the frontend with React.

Here's a video demo of the fungible token creator on NEAR and administration wallet that you'll build in the course:
